# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation with RFM and KMeans Clustering

This project performs customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and KMeans clustering on the **Online Retail II Dataset**. The purpose is to identify customer groups based on purchasing behavior for better business decision-making.

## 📁 Dataset

**Source:** [Kaggle - Online Retail II UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mashlyn/online-retail-ii-uci)  
**Format:** CSV  
**Raw File (Used in this Notebook):** [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a23FkkFUuRLeFDXmYoYpjo5_5FAAYDom/view)

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python (Google Colab)
- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `sklearn` (KMeans, StandardScaler, silhouette_score)
- `yellowbrick` (ElbowVisualizer)

---

## 📊 Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Remove missing values
- Remove negative or canceled transactions
- Filter out non-relevant regions (`United Kingdom` only for this project)

### 2. RFM Calculation
- **Recency**: Days since last purchase
- **Frequency**: Total number of unique invoices
- **Monetary**: Total spending (Quantity × Price)

### 3. Normalization
- Scaled RFM values using `StandardScaler`

### 4. Optimal Cluster Selection
- Compared **Silhouette Score**, **Elbow Method**, and **Yellowbrick**
- Final choice: **4 clusters**

### 5. Clustering
- Applied **KMeans Clustering**
- Assigned cluster labels to each customer

### 6. Cluster Analysis
Performed detailed analysis on each cluster, with focus on:
- Average RFM values per cluster
- Identified high-value customer segment (`Cluster 1`)

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Cluster 1 contains **loyal, high-spending customers**
- Cluster 2 includes **inactive or churned customers**
- Cluster 0 and 3 contain **moderate** or **low-value** customers
- RFM + KMeans is a simple yet powerful method for customer segmentation
